# 🏠 House Price Predictor (End-to-End ML Project)

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices using XGBoost and a real-world housing dataset.

This project focuses not just on model training, but on building a complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to a working web app.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Built a full ML pipeline from scratch  
- Debugged real-world preprocessing issues (scaling, encoding, leakage)  
- Compared Linear Regression vs Tree-based models  
- Engineered meaningful features (house age, renovation signals, ratios)  
- Trained a tuned XGBoost model (~0.70 R² on real data)  
- Converted the model into a working Streamlit web app

## 🧠 Key Learnings

One major takeaway from this project:

> In real-world ML, performance depends more on understanding data than choosing a fancy model.

This project helped me understand:
- How silent bugs like data leakage affect models  
- Why preprocessing matters more than model selection  
- How to transition from notebooks → real ML products

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | R² Score |
|------|---------|
| Linear Regression | ~0.58 |
| XGBoost | ~0.70 |

Performance achieved on real housing data after iterative debugging and feature engineering.
